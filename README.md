# Mathematical Modelling in Medicine and Public Health Coursework 2025
 
Model.py contains most functions used in defining the model and creating the plots. They are then called imported into notebooks to easily interact and manipulate when plotting.

Also included is the coursework brief and my allocated paper, 'Synthetic Gene Network for Entraining and Amplifying Cellular Oscillations', Hasty et al. 2002. My designated variable to change is $\gamma_x$.

Plots used in the report are in the plots folder, as well as some not used but still giving insights.
